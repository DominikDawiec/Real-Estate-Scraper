# Real-Estate-Scraper

I built a scraper for one of the popular housing for sale websites. In addition to basic data about the apartment, the scraper also downloads latitude and longitude, which can be used for interesting analyzes. I will analyze the results of the collected data in another project, where I will want to check how the price per m2 of a flat is influenced by the distance from various service points and cultural centers.
